##### The following outlines what was done to achieve this.

- Completed initial scraping using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter.
- MongoDB was used to store with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped from the URLs above
